Issue Summary:

Duration: April 10th, 2024, 14:00 UTC to April 11th, 2024, 02:00 UTC
Impact: Service outage affecting 30% of users, resulting in slow response times and intermittent errors.
Root Cause: Database overload due to a surge in user activity combined with inefficient query optimization.
Timeline:

14:00 UTC: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating high latency.
14:05 UTC: Engineers investigated frontend services assuming an issue with load balancers.
15:00 UTC: Frontend services deemed healthy; attention shifted to backend systems.
15:30 UTC: Initial assumption of database overload made based on increased query response times.
16:00 UTC: Misleading path pursued, focusing on network congestion which was ruled out.
18:00 UTC: Incident escalated to database team and senior engineers.
20:00 UTC: Database bottleneck identified as the root cause.
21:00 UTC: Temporary mitigation applied to alleviate load and restore service.
02:00 UTC: Permanent fix implemented, resolving the issue.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was identified as database overload resulting from inefficient query optimization and a surge in user activity.
To resolve the issue, database indexes were optimized, query caching mechanisms were implemented, and additional database instances were provisioned to distribute the load effectively.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improve database query optimization strategies to handle increased user activity more efficiently.
Implement proactive monitoring and auto-scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
Task List:
Optimize database indexes to improve query performance.
Implement query caching mechanisms to reduce database load.
Provision additional database instances to distribute workload.
Enhance monitoring alerts to detect database overload earlier.
Conduct regular load testing to identify potential scalability issues before they impact users.
This postmortem serves to provide transparency regarding the recent service outage experienced on April 10th, 2024. We recognize the impact it had on our users and are committed to implementing the necessary measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. Thank you for your understanding and continued support.
